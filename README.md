# Arroba

An unofficial client for ATProto.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` to run the specs. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt powered by [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
